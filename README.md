## Introduction

In this project, we implement an LSTM-based stock price prediction model to forecast stock prices using historical data. The goal is to demonstrate how LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks can be used for financial time series forecasting.

**What is LSTM?**

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture used in the field of deep learning and artificial intelligence. LSTMs are designed to work with sequences of data and are particularly well-suited for tasks that involve sequences, such as time series analysis, natural language processing, speech recognition, and more. LSTMs were introduced to overcome some of the limitations of traditional RNNs, which struggled with capturing long-range dependencies in sequences.

Here are the key components and characteristics of LSTMs:

1. **Memory Cells:** LSTMs have memory cells that can store and retrieve information over long sequences. This memory cell is a key feature that allows LSTMs to capture long-term dependencies in data.

2. **Gates:** LSTMs use gates to control the flow of information into and out of the memory cells. There are three main types of gates:
   - **Forget Gate:** Determines what information from the previous cell state should be thrown away or kept.
   - **Input Gate:** Decides what new information should be stored in the cell state.
   - **Output Gate:** Calculates the final output based on the current cell state.

3. **Cell State:** This is the internal memory of the LSTM. It runs through time and is modified by the gates at each time step. The cell state can carry information across long sequences, making it capable of handling sequences with long-term dependencies.

4. **Hidden State:** The hidden state is used to make predictions at each time step. It is also passed as input to the next time step. It acts as a summary of the information the LSTM has seen so far.

LSTMs are well-suited for sequential data because they can learn to recognize patterns, capture dependencies, and make predictions based on historical data. They are commonly used in tasks such as:

- **Time Series Forecasting:** Predicting future values in a time series, like stock prices, weather data, or sensor readings.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** LSTMs are used in language modeling, text generation, and machine translation.
- **Speech Recognition:** LSTMs can process audio data to convert speech to text.
- **Gesture Recognition:** Recognizing patterns in gesture data.
- **Music Generation:** Generating music sequences.

The ability of LSTMs to handle long-range dependencies and maintain memory over extended sequences makes them a crucial tool in many machine learning and deep learning applications involving sequential data.
## Importing Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dropout, Dense
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
```

We start by importing the necessary Python libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Keras.

## Importing Dataset

```python
data = pd.read_csv('../input/reliance-data/Reliance.csv')
data.dropna(axis=0, inplace=True)
```

We read the stock price data from a CSV file, drop rows with missing values, and prepare the data for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We create various plots to explore the data visually, including scatter plots and line plots for close prices over time, as well as distribution plots.

## Feature Engineering

```python
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
X = data[['Open', 'Low', 'High', 'Volume']].copy()
y = data['Close'].copy()
```

We scale and transform the target and features columns using MinMaxScaler to prepare the data for model training.

## Model Development and Evaluation

```python
# Building the LSTM model
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(128, input_shape=(window, 5), return_sequences=True))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(LSTM(128, input_shape=(window, 5), return_sequences=False))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(Dense(32))
model.add(Dense(1))
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Training the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, batch_size=1, validation_split=0.1, epochs=4)
```

We build and train an LSTM-based model for stock price prediction and evaluate the model using the root mean squared error (RMSE) on the training and test datasets.

## Conclusion

In this project, we applied LSTM networks to predict stock prices, demonstrating the potential for deep learning in financial time series forecasting.

The model achieved a RMSE of 34.92 on the training data and 142.38 on the test data. Further improvements and optimizations can be made to enhance the model's performance.
